Instruction Set for UC128A CPU
All numbers are in hexidecimal

Bus type			# bits		Range

Data address			4 bits		0 to F
Data value			4 bits		0 to F

Program counter (address)	6 bits		00 to 3F
Instruction (value)		8 bits		00 to FF



Mnemonic, hexidecimal code, and description of operations:
c is 4 bit constant
v is 4 bit data address
aa is 6 bit program counter address


Arithmetic instructions (results stored in accumulator)

ADDC	8c	add constant c to accumulator
ADD	9v	add data at v  to accumulator
ANDC	Ac	AND constant c with accumulator
AND	Bv	AND data at v  with accumulator
 ORC	Cc	OR  constant c with accumulator
 OR	Dv	OR  data at v  with accumulator
XORC	Ec	XOR constant c with accumulator
XOR	Fv	XOR data at v  with accumulator

Derived instructions (based on above instructions)

CLR	A0	Clears accumulator to 0,    ANDC 0
SET	CF	Sets accumulaotr to F,       ORC F
NOT	EF	Logical NOT to accumulator, XORC F


Program Flow instructions

JMP     aa	Jump to address aa (aa ranges from 00 to 3F)
SKZ	60	Skip next instruction if accumulator is zero
SKC	70	skip next instruction if accumulator carried


Miscellaneous instructions
NOP	40	No operation
STA	5v	Store accumulator in data address v
